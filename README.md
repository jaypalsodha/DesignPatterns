- It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

Advantages of practicing design pattern
- Imroves software development process
- It gives the developer a selection of tried and tested solution
- Supports reusability and extensibility

# Type of Design Patterns
1. Creational
2. Structural
3. Behavioural


 Creational Pattern
 - Creational pattern aims to separate a system from how its objects are created, composed and represented.

 Purpose of Creational Pattern
 - Generic instantiation
 - Simplicity
 - Creation constraints
 
 Structural Pattern
 - These patterns are used to ease the development by identifying a simple way to realize relationship between the entities.
 
 Purpose of Structural Pattern
 - Performance
 - Refactoring
 - Memory Utilization
 
 Behavioral Pattern
 - These design patterns are used to provide solution for the better interaction between objects and how to provide the loose coupling and flexibility to extend easily.
